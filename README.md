# Customer Support Ticket Router

An OpenEnv environment where an AI agent reads a customer support ticket and decides how to route it — which team handles it, at what priority, and with what urgency.

This is a real enterprise workflow. Organizations processing thousands of support tickets daily rely on accurate routing to reduce resolution time and improve customer satisfaction.

---

## What the agent does

The agent receives a support ticket (subject, body, customer tier) along with team availability data and must output:

| Decision | Options |
|---|---|
| **Primary Team** | Billing · Tech Support · Account · Product · Escalations |
| **Priority** | low · medium · high |
| **Urgency** | low · medium · high |

---

## Observation Space

```
ticket_subject         str    — One-line summary of the issue
ticket_body            str    — Full description written by the customer
customer_tier          str    — standard | premium | enterprise
team_status            list   — Per team: name, queue_length, avg_resolution_time_min, specialization
resolution_history     list   — Last 3 resolved tickets: team, issue_type, success, resolution_time_min
task_type              str    — easy | medium | hard | dynamic
scenario_id            str    — Unique scenario identifier
```

## Action Space

```
primary_team    Literal["Billing","Tech Support","Account","Product","Escalations"]
priority        Literal["low","medium","high"]
urgency         Literal["low","medium","high"]
```

---

## Reward Function

| Condition | Reward |
|---|---|
| Correct team | +0.6 |
| Correct priority | +0.2 |
| Correct urgency | +0.2 |
| Wrong team | −0.3 |
| Chose overloaded team (queue > 10) when better option exists | −0.2 |

Score is clamped to **[0.0, 1.0]**. Partial credit is given — an agent that gets the team right but misses priority still scores 0.6+.

---

## Tasks

### Easy (`task_type="easy"`)
Clear, explicit keywords in the ticket body. All teams have balanced queue lengths. The correct team is unambiguous.

*Example*: "Invoice shows incorrect charge of $250 — please refund immediately" → **Billing / high / high**

### Medium (`task_type="medium"`)
Multi-intent tickets requiring primary intent identification. Moderate team loads. Agent must determine which issue takes precedence.

*Example*: "Can't log in AND have a billing question" → **Account / medium / medium** (login is primary)

### Hard (`task_type="hard"`)
Ambiguous signals + one or more teams overloaded (queue > 10). Agent must reason under load constraints and avoid the overloaded team.

*Example*: "Things seem off since the update..." with Tech Support queue=15 → **Escalations / medium / medium**

### Dynamic (free-form)
Pass any ticket body to `reset()` and the environment infers the expected routing via rule-based analysis. Supports unlimited unique tickets.

## Baseline Agent Performance (Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct)

Achieved with a few-shot prompted system prompt in `inference.py`:

| Task | Avg Score | Scenarios |
|---|---|---|
| Easy | **1.000** | 1.000 · 1.000 · 1.000 |
| Medium | **1.000** | 1.000 · 1.000 · 1.000 |
| Hard | **1.000** | 1.000 · 1.000 · 1.000 |
| **Overall** | **1.000** | |

---

## Setup

### Local (Python)
```bash
cd ticket_router
pip install -r server/requirements.txt
uvicorn server.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Docker
```bash
docker build -t ticket_router-env:latest .
docker run -p 8000:8000 ticket_router-env:latest
```

### Demo UI
Open **http://localhost:8000/demo** — type any ticket, pick a routing, see your score instantly.

## Running Inference

```bash
cd ticket_router
export HF_TOKEN=your_hf_token
export API_BASE_URL=https://router.huggingface.co/v1
export MODEL_NAME=Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct
python inference.py
```

Expected output:
```
[START] task=easy_seed0 env=ticket_router model=Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct
[STEP] step=1 action={"primary_team":"Billing","priority":"high","urgency":"high"} reward=1.00 done=true error=null
[END] success=true steps=1 score=1.000 rewards=1.00

[START] task=medium_seed0 env=ticket_router model=Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct
[STEP] step=1 action={"primary_team":"Account","priority":"medium","urgency":"medium"} reward=1.00 done=true error=null
[END] success=true steps=1 score=1.000 rewards=1.00

=======================================================
FINAL SCORES
  easy    : avg=1.000  [1.000  1.000  1.000]
