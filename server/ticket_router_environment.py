"""
Customer Support Ticket Router — Environment Implementation.

Two modes:

  DYNAMIC (free-form) — User/agent provides any ticket body.
    reset(ticket_body="...", ticket_subject="...", customer_tier="standard")
    The environment infers the expected routing via rule-based analysis.
    Supports infinite unique tickets.

  PRESET (benchmark) — 15 curated scenarios across 3 difficulty levels.
    reset(task_type="easy|medium|hard", seed=0..4)
    Deterministic expected answers enable reproducible RL benchmarks.

Scoring (per episode, single step):
  +0.6  correct team
  +0.2  correct priority
  +0.2  correct urgency
  -0.3  wrong team
  -0.2  overloaded team chosen when a better option exists (queue > 10)

Score is clamped to [0.0, 1.0].
